# Hybrid Model with Attention Mechanism for Melanoma Detection

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Python Version: 3.8 or higher
- GPU Support: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

## Python Dependencies
Ensure that the following dependencies are installed before running the model. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation Instructions

#### Using `requirements.txt`
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies:

```
torch>=1.8.0
torchvision>=0.9.0
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using a GPU, ensure the correct CUDA version is installed. Replace `cu111` with the appropriate version:
```bash
pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111
```
For CPU-only usage:
```bash
pip install torch==1.8.0 torchvision==0.9.0
```

## Dataset Preparation
Ensure that your dataset is structured correctly before running the model.

```
Dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
├── test/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
```
Modify the dataset path in the script accordingly.

## Running the Model

1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify PyTorch Installation
   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.__version__)
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True if GPU is available
   ```

4. Run the Training Script
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Expected Outputs
- The model will train using a 5-fold stratified cross-validation approach.
- After training, the best-performing model weights will be saved.
- Final evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC** will be printed.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that the dataset is correctly formatted and all dependencies are installed correctly.
